# Exploring-Multiple-Processes-and-IPC
Simulated a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory. The CPU and Memory were simulated by separate processes that communicate.

sample5.txt
    The sample 5 program will generate 10 random integers from 1 to 100 and print them out.
    Then it will do a system call to print a line of '-'.
    After return from system call, it will print the sum of the 10 random integers.

project1.c
    source code.
    compile it by typing "gcc project1.c"
    run it by typing "./a.out [input program filename] [timer interrupt value]"
    for example, if we want to run the program with sample3 and timer interrupt value 10, we should type
    "./a.out sample3.txt 10"
